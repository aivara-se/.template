# Agent Instructions

{{REPO_PURPOSE}}

This file is the `aivara-se` agent convention: the rules that hold in every repository. Adopt it, do not fork it. It never describes the state of the work — that lives in the documents below.

## Where a fact lives

- `PRODUCT.md` — what the product is, who it serves, what it must not do, what the work is on now, and what would make it done.
- `SYSTEMS.md` — how it is served, built and checked.
- `DESIGN.md` — the interface and the values it fixes, where there is one.
- `docs/adrs/` — a decision per file, written before the code it decides.
- `README.md` — how to run it locally.

One fact, one home: link to a document, never restate it. A sentence here that starts describing the work instead of how work is done belongs in `PRODUCT.md`.

## House rules

{{REPO_HOUSE_RULES}}

## Tooling

- **Bun runs the scripts.** A script that runs commands is TypeScript, run with `bun run scripts/<name>.ts` — never Python, and a shell script only when it stays a few lines. A command typed at the prompt is not a script.
- **Never** add a second package manager, lockfile, formatter or test runner. The toolchain is the one the repository already declares.
- **Never** report "tests pass", "it builds" or "verified" without the command and the tree it ran against.

## Skills

The organisation's skills live in `aivara-se/.agents/skills` and every agent reads them from there; a repository carries no copy. Each declares a `when-to-use`: open the one that covers the work before starting it.

## Verify before pushing

```bash
{{REPO_CHECK_COMMAND}}
```

Run the whole sequence and read every result — the last exit code says nothing about the first.

## Version Control

- **Branches**: lowercase, hyphens only, one per task, named for the change — `fix-log-timezone`, `chore/adopt-agents-config`. No uppercase, no underscores, no personal prefixes.
- **Commits**: Conventional Commits, lowercase, single line, no scopes — `type: short description`.
- **Never** commit to `{{DEFAULT_BRANCH}}` directly, and **never** force-push a branch someone else has seen.
- Keep history linear: no merge commits, no empty commits, no work-in-progress commits.
- Commit under your own identity, never another agent's.
- Remote work is a branch plus a pull request: the body says what changed, what was verified and how, and what was left out; request review from {{REVIEW_REQUEST_TARGETS}}. Leave the tree clean.
